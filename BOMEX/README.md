For details of the study, see: Siebesma et al 2003 (Cumulus Convection).

These cases were last run with commit 6b1a1939ea5b362af3564aa9b825c4805e24cba0.
Results are for (X x Y x Z) 100 x 100 x 40 m grid spacing and dt = 0.3 time
step with acoustic substepping.

The data files for the Siebesma and FastEddy reference curves were obtained from
