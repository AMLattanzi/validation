# DNS of Turbulent Flow through a Plane Channel

We consider the Reynolds number $Re_\tau = 395$ case (based on friction velocity $u_\tau$ and the
channel half height $\delta$) from Moser, Kim, and Mansour 1999, _Phys. Fluids_.

Reference data were download from [this archive](https://turbulence.oden.utexas.edu/MKM_1999.html).

For more information about the simulation setup, see `Examples/Channel_DNS/README.md` in the ERF
source code repository.
