*Ray trace rendering of the supercell evolution highlighting the main features. Isocontours of cloud water ($q_c = 10^-5$ [kg/kg]) in white and rain water ($q_r = 10^-4$ [kg/kg]) in blue are shown.*

Isocontour of cloud water mixing ratio ($q_c = 10^{-5}$ [kg/kg]) in white, rain water mixing ratio ($q_r = 10^{-4}$ [kg/kg]) in red, and contours of potential temperature perturbation (y=0 and z=0 slices) ($\theta_d^{\prime} = \theta_d(t) - \theta_d(0)$ [K]) at $t = 1800$ s, and 7200 s, and the total rain accumulation on the ground in mm at $t = 7200$ s (top to bottom).
