# Three-dimensional super cell

### Figure 1: Ray trace rendering of the supercell evolution highlighting the main features. 
Isocontours of cloud water (`q_c = 10^-5` [kg/kg]) in white and rain water (`q_r = 10^-4` [kg/kg]) in blue are shown.

### Figure 2: Evolution of the three-dimensional supercell.
Isocontour of cloud water mixing ratio (`q_c = 10^-5` [kg/kg]) in white, rain water mixing ratio (`q_r = 10^-4` [kg/kg]) in red, and contours of potential temperature perturbation (y=0 and z=0 slices) (`θ_d′ = θ_d(t)-θ_d(0)` [K]) at t = 1800s, and 7200s, and the total rain accumulation on the ground in mm at t = 7200s (top to bottom).
