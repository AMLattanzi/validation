# Density Current

The test case is two-dimensional with domain lengths $(L_x, L_z) = (25.6\times 10^3, 6.4\times 10^3)$ [m] and has a grid resolution of $(\Delta x, \, \Delta z) = (100.0, \, 100.0)$ [m]. The simulation is run for 900 [s] of simulated time with an RK3 time step of 1.0 [s] and 4 acoustic sub-steps in the last RK stage. The left boundary employs a symmetry condition while the right boundary is an outflow condition. The top and bottom boundaries are slip walls. The 3$^\text{rd}$ order upwind scheme and constant diffusivities of $\nu$ = $\alpha_{\theta}$ = 75 [m$^2$/s] were employed; no turbulence model was used.
